Testing README file
Hello GitHub! My name is Jim super excited to be here!
I am a student and I love to work with computers both physically and through coding
I believe that coding is the future of technology and I believe that learning coding programs such as java, python or c++ can be useful in any career
I would like to pursue engineering, in the future. 
Even though the profession doesn't involve using coding software directly, I still think that learning coding programs or even learning how to code can be very useful
Coding can not only help your knowledge in software but can also help you with your problem-solving skills, time management and effective communication
I believe that this course and using GitHub can further my knowledge in coding aspects whether it be in error checking, writing code or condensing/efficiently writing the code
